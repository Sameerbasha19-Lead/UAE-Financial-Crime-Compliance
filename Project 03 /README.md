**UAE AML/CFT Compliance Framework & Risk Engine**

**📌 Project Overview**

This project demonstrates a Risk-Based Approach (RBA) to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance, designed specifically for the UAE regulatory environment. It operationalizes the requirements of Federal Decree-Law No. (20) of 2018 and Cabinet Decision No. (10) of 2019.

The repository contains two key artifacts:

Interactive Customer Risk Assessment Matrix (CRAM): A web-based tool that calculates Inherent Risk scores using a weighted-average algorithm.

Mock Suspicious Activity Report (SAR): A procedural document demonstrating the analysis and reporting of "Structuring" typologies to the UAE Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).

**🛠️ Technical & Legal Logic**

The Risk Engine is built to automate the mandates of Article 4 (Risk Identification) of Cabinet Decision No. 10.

1. Risk Weighting Methodology

| Risk Factor | Weight | Legal Basis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Customer Type | 30% | Article 15 |
| Geography | 30% | Article 22 |
| Product | 25% | Article 4.1.a |
| Channel | 15% | Article 4.1.a |

2. Decision Logic

Low Risk (< 2.0): Triggers Simplified Due Diligence (SDD) as per Article 4.3.

High Risk (> 3.5): Automatically triggers Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) requirements, including:

Source of Wealth (SOW) corroboration.

Senior Management Approval (Article 15).

UBO Unwrapping (Article 9 - 25% ownership threshold).
